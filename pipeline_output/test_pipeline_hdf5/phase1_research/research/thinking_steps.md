# Research Thinking Steps

## Step 1
**Initial Research Strategy**

I am initiating the research process for the HDF5 file format report, focusing on its architecture, best practices, and advanced usage. I have prioritized two primary authoritative sources provided: the official HDF Group documentation and their GitHub repository. My strategy involves systematically extracting core information from these official sources first, and then broadening the search to include 'human voice' content, such as specialized blog posts and forum discussions, to gather diverse perspectives on performance tuning and real-world implementation challenges. I will also be looking for specifics like HDF5 chunking strategies and parallel I/O techniques.

## Step 2


**Focusing the Research Scope**

To ensure comprehensive coverage, I've outlined key advanced topics that will guide my deeper searches if the initial documentation is too high-level. These include crucial performance features like chunking, parallel I/O (MPI integration), the Virtual Object Layer, and specialized access modes like SWMR (Single Writer Multiple Reader). These technical specifics are essential for crafting the 'Advanced Usage Patterns' section of the report.

## Step 3


**Next Steps: Accessing Core Documentation**

My immediate plan is to use the provided URLs to begin gathering foundational knowledge. I will first browse the HDF Group documentation website to locate the 'User's Guide' and 'Architecture' documents. Subsequently, I will examine the GitHub repository to find any specialized documentation files, code examples, or READMEs that explain internal workings or advanced usage patterns, setting the stage for the synthesis phase.
