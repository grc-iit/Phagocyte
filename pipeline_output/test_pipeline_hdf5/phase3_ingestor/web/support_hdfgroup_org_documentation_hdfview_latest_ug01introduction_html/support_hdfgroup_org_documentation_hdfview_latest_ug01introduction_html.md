##  1.1 Overview
HDFView is a Java-based tool for browsing and editing HDF4 and HDF5 files. HDFView allows users to browse through any HDF4 and HDF5 file, starting with a tree view of all top-level objects in an HDF file's hierarchy. HDFView allows a user to descend through the hierarchy and navigate among the file's data objects. The content of a data object is loaded only when the object is selected, providing interactive and efficient access to HDF4 and HDF5 files. HDFView editing features allow a user to create, delete, and modify the value of HDF objects and attributes.
The HDFView graphical user interface (GUI) is simple and easy-to-use. First, HDFView was implemented by using the JavaTM Platform and SWTTM UI, which is machine-independent. The GUI components have the same native look-and-feel for the machine. Second, HDFView uses conventional folders and icons to display groups and datasets in a tree structure. Users can easily expand or collapse folders to navigate the hierarchical structure of an HDF file. Third, HDFView shows data content as text (table or plain text) or as an image.
