This is the documentation set for HDF5. It includes specifications and documentation of software and tools developed and maintained by [The HDF Group](https://www.hdfgroup.org/). It is impractical to document the entire HDF5 ecosystem in one place, and you should also consult the documentation sets of the many outstanding community projects.
For a first contact with HDF5, the best place is to have a look at the [getting started ](https://support.hdfgroup.org/documentation/hdf5/latest/_getting_started.html) page that shows you how to write and compile your first program with HDF5.
The **main** **documentation** is organized by documentation flavor. Most technical documentation consists to varying degrees of information related to _tasks_ , _concepts_ , or _reference_ material. As its title suggests, the [Reference Manual ](https://support.hdfgroup.org/documentation/hdf5/latest/_r_m.html) is 100% reference material, while the [Cookbook](https://support.hdfgroup.org/documentation/hdf5/latest/_cookbook.html) is focused on tasks. The different guide-type documents cover a mix of tasks, concepts, and reference, to help a specific _audience_ succeed.
