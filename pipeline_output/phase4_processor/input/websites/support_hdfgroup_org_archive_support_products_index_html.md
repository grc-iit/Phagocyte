# HDF Products
## HDF Group Products
HDF technologies consist of two data management formats (HDF4 and HDF5) and associated libraries, a modular data browser/editor (HDFView), associated tools and utilities and a conversion library. Both HDF4 and HDF5 were designed to be general scientific formats adaptable to virtually any scientific or engineering application and have also been used successfully in non-technical areas. 
HDF5 addresses important deficiencies of HDF4. Thus it is recommended that new applications use HDF5. HDF5 takes advantage of the latest computing advances to enable the storage of extremely large and complex datasets where scalability, fast I/O, and data sharing are important.
